{"query": "Why Katniss Everdeen didn’t want to talk about girl whose tongue had been cut she had seen back in the district twelve with Gale?", "docs": ["I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone who might be able to help me figure out her story. Gale would be my first choice, but it’s unlikely I’ll ever see Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me, but I don’t see how. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend.\nBesides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me. She has reminded me why I’m here. Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer."], "result": "Katniss Everdeen didn’t want to talk about the girl whose tongue had been cut because the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens her. She reminds Katniss of the grim reality of why she is in the Games, not for glamour but to potentially die a violent death while being watched by an encouraging crowd."}

How could you possibly know an Avox?\" snaps Effie. \n\"The very thought.\"\n\"What’s an Avox?\" I ask stupidly.\n\"Someone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so she can’t speak,\" says Haymitch. \n\"She’s probably a traitor of some sort. Not likely you’d know her.\"\n\"And even if you did, you’re not to speak to one of them unless it’s to give an order\", says Effie. \"Of course, you don’t really know her.\""], "result": "An Avox in the book 'Hunger Games' by Suzanne Collins is someone who has committed a crime and as a punishment, their tongue has been cut out so they cannot speak. They are often considered traitors and are used as servants, unable to speak unless it is to respond to an order."}
{"query": "Why tributes cannot commit a suicide before the games begin by jumping from the roof at the Training center where u can see the whole city?", "docs": ["Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I look straight down the side of the building to the street, which is buzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional shout, and a strange metallic tinkling. In District 12, we’d all be thinking about bed right now.\n\"I asked Cinna why they let us up here. Weren’t they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side?\" says Peeta.\n\"What’d he say?\" I ask.\n\"You can’t,\" says Peeta. He holds out his hand into seemingly empty space. There’s a sharp zap and he jerks it back. \"Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof.\"\n\n\"Always worried about our safety,\" I say. Even though Cinna has shown Peeta the roof, I wonder if we’re supposed to be up here now, so late and alone."], "result": "Tributes cannot commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the Training Center because there is an electric field in place that prevents them from doing so. If a tribute tries to jump, the electric field activates and throws them back onto the roof, ensuring their safety until the games begin."}

{"query": "Why reaping system in \"HG\" is unfair if it's applied to all citizens?", "docs": ["But here's the catch. Say you are poor and starving, as we were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meagre year's supply of grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered four times. Once because I had to, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim and my mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times."], "result": "The reaping system in 'The Hunger Games' is considered unfair because it disproportionately affects poorer citizens. Those who are poor and need extra food can opt to have their names entered more times into the reaping in exchange for tesserae, which provide a small supply of grain and oil. This means that poorer families, who need more resources to survive, end up with a significantly higher chance of being chosen to participate in the deadly games compared to wealthier families who do not need to take additional tesserae."}
